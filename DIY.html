     <video src="Image/DragonPr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>Recently i came up with an cute Dragon design, so i made a figure of it out of polymer clay.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/DragonPr2.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>After i finished the first Dragon figure i was so motivated that i started to make various kechain in that design..</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
     <video src="Image/CrochetPr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>This was my first crochet project ever, at first it was confusing but at some point i got the hang of it.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/CrochetPr2.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>After the first crochet project turned out pretty decent i made some keychains for my friends. A fish and a octopus.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/GengarPr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>I made this Gengar out of Polymer clay. After that i painted it with acrylic paint and sprayed it with a glossy finish.
	 it was a gift for a really precious person.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
    <img src="Image/CarPr1.jpg" alt="Project 6">
    <p>While searching the internet i found out about papercraft. I then stumbled upon this template of a Trueno AE86 and i just had to make it...</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/DBPr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p> This was one of my bigger projects. I made Super Saiyan from Dragon Ball out of polymer clay. Then he was painted with acrilic paint and the black lines were added with markers. It was a christmas gift for a family member.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/DrawPr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>This was just a litte art project, where i wanted to paint the main characters of the game i am developing right now. I used staedler coloured pencils on an cardboard.</p>
  </div>
  
   <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/Live2dPr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>One day i just picked up Live2D because i saw it online and tought it was interesting to work with. Long story short,  this is how my persona you see all over my website was born.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
   <img src="Image/PuppetPr1.jpg" alt="Project 6">
    <p>Again, i saw something online i had to do. It were these cute chibi characters that were made out of fabric and sewn together. I made one for my best friends birthday, that looked like her. </p>
  </div>
  
   <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/ShoePr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>I found my old shoes in the basement..but i didn't want to throw them away...so i started painting them to my liking. Since my favourite color is green and flames look edgy, these shoes were made.</p>
  </div>
  
   <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/ShoePr2.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>When i saw cell shaded shoes online i had to try it for myself. I combined it with one of my favourite Games and so these Borderlands-style Shoes were born.</p>
  </div>
  
   <div class="gallery-item">
    <video src="Image/GenshinPr1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
    <p>I was a huge Genshin Impact fan so i made this Kazuha figure out of polymer clay, including his sword. He's about 20cm tall and took about 2 full days to make.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="gallery-item">
   <img src="Image/CardPr1.jpg" alt="Card Game">
    <p> Since i love the idea of trading card games but also simple board games,
	i started to make my own. You can play it with up to 4 people. At the start, 
	everyone randomly gets 4 different monster cards which then can be used to battle against eachother,
	or capture moremonsters or even evolve them to make them even stronger.</p>
