		<p>2025: I made some type of space shooter game as a small side project. The game tracks it background music and spawns
		different types of enemies at specific frequencies that the music hits in its spectrum, it is still not finished but i
		am planning on working on it again someday.</p>

			<h3> I started making a game in August 2024. The idea was to make an story driven RPG with a top-down perspective in pixelart style.
			But troughout developement my vision and ideas changed and i had to better define the scope of the whole game especially as a single person developer.
			In this devlog i document the journey of making a game on your own.</h3>

		<p>January 2026: I started crafting more 3D Models of houses and different kinds of things to make the scene feel more alive. 
         I also fixed and redrew some player sprites, so they are up to date and not missing any animations.</p>
	</div>

		<video src="Image/video3.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>September 2025: I finished a prototype of what the worlds and cities may look like in the future.
		This Version still needs some polish but overall i feel like it's a huge improvement.</p>

		<video src="Image/video4.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>July 2025: After i finished various different 3D Models my vision started to come to life..slowly but surely. I made 3D Models for static objects that wouldn't move, like Houses, Lamps, Tree Trunks; Fences etc...everything that is organic, 
		will be portrayed with 2D sprites, like for example NPC's, Flowers or the Player itself.</p>
	</div>
  
	<div class="gallery-item">
		<video src="Image/video5.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>July 2025: I realised, i had too little artistic freedom with the 2D top-down perspective, so i made the hard desicion to change the complete style of the old game. 
		I wanted more freedom in portraying the outer world and feel, so i started making 3D Models out of my 2D sprites to achive a 2.5D look.</p>
	</div>
  
	<div class="gallery-item">
		<video src="Image/video7.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>June 2025: I scrapped the idea of fighting in the overworld. After a lot of testing and different approaches i came to the conclusion that a turn based battle system would fit more...so i drew the characters more detailed so i could better portray them in a turn based battle system.
		This is the first prototype of how the battle system could look like.

		<video src="Image/video6.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>April 2025: The Dialogue System got a small redesign and better character portraits and also the ability to be influenced by player choices.
		</p>

		<video src="Image/video11.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>April 2025: I've drawn and added skilltrees for all party members.
		</p>
	</div>
  
	<div class="gallery-item">
		<video src="Image/video8.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>March 2025: I experimented with different mini games i could implement to make the world feel more alive and fun.
		</p>
	</div>
  
	<div class="gallery-item">
		<video src="Image/video10.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>February 2025: I gave the whole UI a new look, to make it look more polised and make it easier on the eyes. Also i added a crafting system, so the player would be able to craft new weapons and accesories.
		</p>
	</div>
  
	<div class="gallery-item">
		<video src="Image/video9.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>January 2025: I decided to redesign the characters and Tilemap, so it would look more polished.
		</p>
	</div>
  
	<div class="gallery-item">
		<video src="Image/video1.mp4" class="overlay-image" width="250" height="150" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
		<p>September 2024: I changed the character selection, so when a charcter is selected, it spawns at the point the Player is now standing. While moving with one Member, the other party members are inactive. Also i added a running state, so the Player could move faster if he wanted to and some fighting Animations.
		</p>

		<p>August 2024: I started making my Game. I build in a simple Inventory System, Dialogue System, Day and NIght Cycle and moveable Player Characters.
		The Player could switch between all 3 Characters, which made the world feel more alive...But i soon realized that this type of controls could become
		confusing and Gameplay wise there was no purpose for the player to be able to switch between the 3 positions where the characters were standing,
		so i decided to change the Way the Player would change from character to character.</p>
