Hello! This is the README of my Website.

About:

This website and all its components including art, videos were made by me. It consists of pure HTML, CSS and Javascript and has no other dependencies. I made it in my free time to be able to better portray myself and the projects, i have, and am, working on. 
Moving pieces on my website mainly consist of a Gif of individual sprites i have drawn. Other than that, the functionality of the minigame(top right) is plainly simple, it is just a gif that changes to a different gif when clicked on. 

Plant Minigame:

In the top right corner of the page, you cna find a minigame of a plant that needs to be watered. By clicking on it you can water the plant and let it grow. Every 3rd click triggers an evolution. There are 3 evolution stages in total.

stage 1: small sprout -> can be clicked on 3 times to let it grow into it's next evolution stage.

stage 2: medium sprout -> can be clicked on 3 times to let it grow into it's next evolution stage.

stage 3: slime(fully evolved) -> can be clicked on to pet. This is the final stage...(i may add a new one in the future)


Ideas for future:

-add a new seperate page to show my music projects.
-do more stages in the minigame, or add cosmetics
-add unity API so a demo of my game is playable.
-add more WIP videos or screenshots.
-add a seperate page about the game i am programming itself(story, characters, landscapes...)
